Mission 'Arnold Follow Demo' came from treatment 2 used in for RO-MAN 2016 conference.

It has been cleaned and updated for use as a general demonstration of
using Speech for working with an autonomous teammate. Ideally it
reflects the current state of the art in the lab.

Simulation:  To run the simulation simply
$ ./launch.sh

On the water: Run several launch scripts.  On the vehicles make sure
to modify the SHORE_IP value to point at the shoreside computer.

$ ./launch_shoreside.sh

$ ./launch_hunter.sh

$ ./launch_vehicle.sh -robot_initial
