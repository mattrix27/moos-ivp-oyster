Button_Record_Test README

Info:

	- NOTE: Ater plugging in arduino, check /dev/ for the device with the name tty.usbmodemXXXXX where X is an arbitrary number, and note this name. Then insert the path to the device after the "PATH: " configuration line in the config block for iButtonBox in your mission's (or this mission's .moos file.

	- This demo mission uses both pRecord and iButtonBox to record audio via button presses, see /trunk/src/pRecord and /trunk/src/iButtonBox for source code.
	
	- Configure pLogger with a directory to store logs of when buttons are pressed. See the .moos for an example of how pLogger was configured with a "logs" directory.

	- Recording files will be saved into the mission directory of the .moos file where pRecord is called, as you can see from the two example .wav files in this directory.

	- Included in this demo directory is an example launch file to test both iButtonBox and pRecord together.
