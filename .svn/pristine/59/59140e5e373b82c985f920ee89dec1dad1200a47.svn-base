pRecord App README

Dependencies:

	The app requires both PortAudio and libsndfile (both header files are included in this directory). Read README_SPEECH_DEPENDENCIES for how to install dependencies (apt for Ubuntu and macports for MacOS).

Demo:

	Look at trunk/missions/button_record_test/ for an example of how pRecord interacts with iButtonBox.

Info:

	- Configure pLogger with a directory to store logs of when buttons are pressed. See the demo mission for an example of how pLogger was configured with a "logs" directory.

	- Recording files will be saved into the mission directory of the .moos file where pRecord is called.

	- Included in the demo mission is an example launch file to test both iButtonBox and pRecord together.
