This mission is the union of the Heron M300 alpha mission and that of using a PABLO box on an autonomous kayak.  The Heron M300s use just the launch_vehicle.sh script with a vehicle name flag.  However, the Kayak requires that the operator start the front seat as well as the back seat.  It is assumed that this folder is on both the front and backseat at the locations described below.


Steps to run the kayak Nostromo are:

Step 1: log onto the kayak front seat:
$ ssh mit@192.168.1.103

pword is hovergroup

Step 2: move to the directory with the front seat mission

/hovergroup/moos-ivp-2680/missions/lab

Step 3: modify the launch script to include the proper PABLO IP address
$ emacs launch_kayak_front_seat.sh

update the variable called BACKSEAT_IP

Step 4: launch the script
$ ./launch_kayak_front_seat.sh --nostromo

Step 5: in a new window, log onto the PABLO box
$ ssh student2680@192.168.1.242

pword is waterbots

Step 6: move to the directory with the backseat mission

/home/student2680/moos-ivp-aquaticus/missions/alpha_kayak

Step 7: update the Shore IP in the launch script
$ emacs launch_vehicle.sh

update the variable SHORE_IP

Step 8: run the launch script
$ ./launch_vehicle.sh -n
