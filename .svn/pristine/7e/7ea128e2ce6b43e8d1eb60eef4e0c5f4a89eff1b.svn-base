iButtonBox README

- This is the arduino interface app between pRecord and buttons that control when recording and speech recognition happens

- This works by reading signals from an arduino inputs (to which pushbuttons are connected) and posting them as MOOS variables

- Two IMPORTANT pieces of information are as follows:

  1. Upon connecting the arduino to the computer, check /dev/ for a device named tty.usbmodemXXXXX where X is an arbitrary number which denotes the arduino. Then insert the path to the device i.e. /dev/tty.usbmodemXXXXX after "PATH:" in the iButtonBlock configuration block in your mission's .moos file

  2. Also look at the .moos file in this directory for an example of how to name buttons to certain MOOS variables
