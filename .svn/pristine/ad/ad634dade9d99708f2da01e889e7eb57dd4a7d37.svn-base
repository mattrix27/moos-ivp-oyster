Hi guys - Let me try to clarify what I'm looking for as a next step. 

I'd like to be able to make new mission configurations (.moos+.bhv) for 
vehicles playing our game. 

For example, I'd like the ability to configure:

1. an "attack" mode where the autonomous vehicle simply makes a dash 
to the enemy flag until it gets caught or succeeds. Only evasion of 
the enemy is collision avoidance.

Can we get the word"attack" added to the vocabulary? e.g. "Davis attack"

2. a "cover" mode where the autonomous vehicle tries to stay between 
the commanding vehicle and any enemy, hopefully drawing tags so the 

Can we get the word "cover" added to the vocabulary? e.g. "Evan attack"

3. A "hold" mode where the autonomous vehicle stations for prescribed
set of time before resuming what it was doing. 

Can we get the word "holdN" added to the vocabulary? e.g. "Gus hold20"
would ask Gus to station for 20 seconds before timing out.

4. A defense mode for our robots such that they will only tag if the 
enemy has the flag, i.e., they will ignore a vehicle entering the home
side, but as soon as the enemy has the flag, it will try to cut-range
and tag.

Can we get the word "notag" added to the vocabulary? e.g. "Evan notag"

As a first step, I'm looking to confirm that we can add the above words
to our system. 

Q: Where does this happen in configuration? 
Q: Are there changes
needed to the code? 
Q: Do we start to see an increase in "verbal collisions", i.e., words
mistakenly heard as another word in our vocabulary, as we grow the size 
of the vocabulary? 
Q; How robust is achieving the above to the particular
voices of our team? 
Q: Can we test with some women in the lab? 

Q: If we do 
have verbal collisions, can we improve the situation by training? 

Q: Can we improve by choosing
our words more wisely?
