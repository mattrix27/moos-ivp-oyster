Using iJoystick on Mac OS X:

For all joysticks:
  $ sudo port install libsdl2

In addition, if using a Microsoft XBox 360 controller on OS X:
  Launch the attached .dmg and follow its instructions
  Reboot the Mac

The .dmg file is in the moos-ivp-aquaticus/data/ directory.

If you are using an NVIDIA Jetson TX1 (presumably in a Mokai),
you will need to install libsdl2-dev as well:

  $ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev

Note that the package libsdl2 works as well, but is not available
through the Jetson's default repositories.
