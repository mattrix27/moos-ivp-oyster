Instructions to verify the aquaticus-USMA simulation.

For any major update, update the SVN repository
$ cd ~/moos-ivp-aquaticus

$ svn update

$./build.sh


To run the simulation:

$ cd ~/moos-ivp-aquaticus/missions/aquaticus-USMA

$./launch_simulation.sh

Four vehicles should be launched.  The two red team robots, the human operated vehicle blue_one and the autonomous teammate labelled blue_two.

To initiate all the vehicles, press on the DEPLOY button in pMarineViewer in the lower right-hand corner.


To test the autonomous robots:

After the DEPLOY button has been selected in pMarineViewer, the autonomous robots will move to their default position.  Press the spacebar or alternatively, select the Action drop-down menu at the top of pMarineViewer and select 'Open Command GUI'

This will open up the COMMAND GUI.  To verify an autonomous robot's different modes, find the group of buttons relevant to that robot (e.g. red_one) and then click on a button labeled with the mode you wish to test (e.g. ATTACK).  NOTE1: not all modes are active for all autonomous robots. NOTE2: the human operated vehicle BLUE_ONE does not respond to these buttons as it is supposed to be operated via game controller.


To view the opponent red team trials E1-5, H1-5:

In pMarineViewer, click on the Action drop-down menu at the top of the window.

The labels for each trial is labeled <E#> or <H#>.  For example, to start <H2> trial, go down the drop-down menu and find anyone of the items that end in <H2> and click on it.  The robots should then initiate that trial.  Note: there are sometimes multiple buttons associated with a trial - this is simply for debugging purposes to see what is going on behind the scenes -- you will only need to click on one of the items to trigger all of them for a trial.



To test independent variable settings  with autonomous teammate blue two:

The different options such as RELIABLE/NOTRELIABLE and HIGH/LOW AUTONOMY can be selected view the Action drop-down menu in pMarineViewer.  They are so labeled at the end of each button with <RELIABLE> <NOTRELIABLE>, <LOWAUTONOMY>, <HIGHAUTONOMY> on the right side of the pull-down menu.

To RUN the training per participant:
$ cd ~/moos-ivp/aquaticus/missions/aquaticus-USMA
$ ./train_1.sh

train_1.sh will run just the human operate vehicle on the field to practice joystick control and game mechanics

$ ./train_2.sh
train_2.sh will run the human operated vehicle on the field and its autonomous robot teammate.

Run ktm after end of each simulation round.  This ensures that nothing is accidentally still running from before.

To run the simulation per participant per group and round:
cid stands for competition id
pid is participant id
group is the group number
round is the round number

$ cd ~/moos-ivp-aquaticus/missions/aquaticus-USMA
$ ./launch_simulation.sh --cid=# --pid=# --group=# --round=#

To make all vehicles active:  Click on lower right button 'DEPLOY'

To start the Aquaticus game: on the dropdown menu select 'AQUATICUS_GAME_ALL=TRUE'
This will start the different trials
