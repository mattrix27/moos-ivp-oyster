The leftmost column is seconds from start time.  The second column is the variable name.  The third column is the application name.  The fourth column is the recorded variable value.  We are looking at the sound files being played per event (easiest way to see what is happening). The sound files will have a variable value of file=sounds/grab_post_blue_one.wav for example.



game start/stop = AQUATICUS_GAME_ALL = start/stop

flag grabbed = grab_post_(blue/red one/two)

flags returned (due to being tagged) = lose_post_(red/blue)

flags captured (score a point) = goal_post_(red or blue)

number of times tagged = tag_post_(blue/red, 1/2)



results of match (wins v losses):  calculate the number of flag captures per team (show up as goal_post...).  The team with the most flags captured wins.  If both teams have an equal number of flag captures, then it is the team with the most flag grabs (shows up as grab_post...) that wins.
