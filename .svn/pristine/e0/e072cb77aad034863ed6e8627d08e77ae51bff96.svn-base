Running Project Aquaticus Simulation Experiment and checking Log Files:

To start an experiment from within the missions\aquaticus-USMA folder:
$ ./launch_simulation.sh --round=1 --group=1 --pid=1 --cid=1

As an experimenter I click on the screen:
1.  ’DEPLOY’ button and the 
2.  ‘AQUATICUS_GAME_ALL=play’ in the action pull-down menu



When 10 minutes has run out — I then click on the screen:
‘AQUATICUS_GAME_ALL=stop’ in the action pull-down menu


Log Files are found within the directory structure with their own subfolders:

missions/aquaticus-USMA
				/shoreside
					/C0001_LOG_SHORESIDE_28_2_2019_____12_20_58/
											C001_LOG_SHORESIDE_28_2_2019_____12_20_58.alog
				/mokai
					/C001_P001_LOG_DONA_BLUE_ONE_28_2_2019_____12_20_56/
												C001_P001_LOG_DONA_BLUE_ONE_28_2_2019_____12_20_56.alog
				/heron
					/C001_LOG_HAL_BLUE_TWO_28_2_2019_____12_20_55

					/C001_LOG_FELIX_RED_TWO_28_2_2019_____12_20_54
					/C001_LOG_EVAN_RED_ONE_28_2_2019______12_20_53
				

The data is viewed by looking inside the folders for each vehicle looking for a file with the extension '.alog'  Each vehicle and shoreside should be creating a new folder for each time that they are run which lists the date and time started.
 
To see what variables are logged:
$ alogscan vehicle.alog
 
To select certain the output of only a few of the variables:
$ aloggrep vehicle.alog [VARIABLE_LIST]
for example $ aloggrep vehicle.alog SAY_MOOS SPEECH_RECOGNITION_SENTENCE

To check for Aquaticus game starting and stopping:

 aloggrep C001_P001_LOG_DONA_BLUE_ONE_28_2_2019_____12_27_15.alog AQUATICUS_GAME*
aloggrep - Processing on file: C001_P001_LOG_DONA_BLUE_ONE_28_2_2019_____12_27_15.alog
